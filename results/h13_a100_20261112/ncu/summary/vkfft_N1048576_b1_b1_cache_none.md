DRAM bytes undercount traffic (writes deferred in L2); judge this config by L2 metrics.

L2 limit method: total LTS bytes divided by the measured L2 read plateau; no read/write sector split is inferred.

Complete capture: 2 kernel launches; totals are measured, not extrapolated.

Config totals (raw traffic ratio = total DRAM bytes / (2 × 16 × N × batch); calibrated passes divide by the HBM copy traffic factor):

Legacy copy-normalized percentages are retained. pct_mixed_hbm_limit adds read/write service times at their separately measured peaks; pct_l2_limit uses the measured read plateau. NCU replay durations are distinct from unprofiled sweep times.

Exported kernel count: 2; captured launch count: 2; expected execution launches: 2.
